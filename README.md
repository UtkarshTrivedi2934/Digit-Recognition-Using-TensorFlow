# Digit-Recognition-Using-TensorFlow
A computer vision application that utilizes the popular machine learning framework, TensorFlow, to recognize and classify hand-drawn or printed digits

This technology has wide-ranging applications, such as reading postal codes on envelopes, identifying numbers on checks, and enabling digit-based commands in gesture recognition systems. By training deep neural networks on extensive datasets of handwritten and printed digits, TensorFlow provides a powerful tool for accurately recognizing and distinguishing numerical characters, making it a fundamental component of many optical character recognition (OCR) and image analysis systems.
